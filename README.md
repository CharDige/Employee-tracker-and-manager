## Description

This project supports users, such as business owners, to be able to easily view and interact with databases to keep track of and manage their workplaces, such as viewing all their departments, roles within departments, salaries, employees, and more.

When a user starts the application using `npm start` in the command-line, the user is brought to the "Employee tracker and manager", which provides a list of actions the user can take. These includes viewing all departments, roles and employees; adding new departments, roles, and employees; updating managers or roles of employees; and more.

Once the user is finished using the "Employee tracker and manager", they can select "Quit", which will end the connection to the database.

### Screenshots

After the installation process has been undertaken, the user can begin the application by entering `npm start` into the command-line.

The user will be presented with a number of choices to select from, including viewing all departments, roles and employees; adding new departments, roles, and employees; updating managers or roles of employees; and more.

When the user selects `View all departments`, `View all roles` or `View all employees`, they will be presented with a table that will list all the departments, roles and employees within the database.

**View all departments**

**View all roles**

![Command-line showing table of all roles in database](./images/view-roles-screenshot.PNG)

**View all employees**

![Command-line showing table of all employees in database](./images/view-employees-screenshot.PNG)

When the user selects any of the other choices (except for `Quit`), they will be presented with either one or multiple prompts in the command-line for information. This could be inputting information for adding a new employee or selecting a department to remove, for example.

A couple of these options will result in a table being presented, such as `View employees by manager`, `View employees by department` and `View total budget of a department`. The rest receive a notification confirming that data has been updated.

**Add department**

**Add role**

![Command-line asking for role title, salary and department of role, then showing a role had been added](./images/add-role-screenshot.PNG)

**Add employee**

**Update employee role**

**Update employee manager**

![Command-line asking for employee name and the new manager, then shows the data had been updated](./images/updated-manager-screenshot.PNG)

**View employees by manager**

![Command-line asking for manager name, then shows table of employee's who report to that manager](./images/view-emp-manager-screenshot.PNG)

**View employees by department**

![Command-line asking for department name, then shows table of employee's in that department](./images/view-emp-department-screenshot.PNG)

**View total budget of a department**

![Command-line asking for department name, then shows table of the department and it's total budget](./images/view-total-budget-screenshot.PNG)

**Remove department**

![Command-line asking for department name, then removes the department from database](./images/remove-dept-screenshot.PNG)

**Remove role**

![Command-line asking for role title, then removes the role from database](./images/remove-role-screenshot.PNG)

**Remove employee**

![Command-line asking for employee name, then removes the employee from database](./images/remove-employee-screenshot.PNG)


Once the user is finished using the employee tracker and manager, they can select `quit`, which ends the connection with the database. The user will be presented with a line that thanks them for using the application to notify them that they have quit the application.
